# Every script begins in the working directory of the project root, as set in setup.sh, and uses relative paths.
# Plugin scripts, found elsewhere on the host machine, use absolute paths.
# Occasionally, one of the scripts changes the working directory for a bit, and will still need to log what it is up to.
# So we'll resolve the installer's log file to an absolute path so they can do so.
